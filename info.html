            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>In the "green" rest frame:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The green rocket is stationary</li>
                <li>The red rocket is moving to the right at speed 0.866c.</li>
                <li>The clocks of the "green" rocket are synchronized.</li>
                <li>The clocks of the "red" rocket are out-of-synch.</li>
                <li>The clocks of the "red" rocket run at one-half the rate of those of the "green" rocket.</li>
                <li>The front clock (the right clock) of the "red" rocket is 45 minutes behind that of the rear clock (the left clock).</li>
                <li>The length of the "red" rocket is one-half that of the "green" rocket.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>In the "red" rest frame:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The red rocket is stationary.</li>
                <li>The green rocket is moving to the left at speed 0.866c</li>
                <li>The clocks of the "red" rocket are synchronized.</li>
                <li>The clocks of the "green" rocket are out-of-synch.</li>
                <li>The clocks of the "green" rocket run at one-half the rate of those of the "red" rocket.</li>
                <li>The front clock (the left clock, since it's moving to the left) of the "green" rocket is 45 minutes ahead of that of the rear clock.</li>
                <li>The length of the "green" rocket is one-half that of the "red" rocket.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Formulas</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"gamma factor" = 1/sqrt(1-v^2/c^2)</li>
                <li>length of moving rocket contracted by a factor of gamma</li>
                <li>rate of moving clock slows by a factor of gamma</li>
                <li>offset of clocks on board moving rocket = gamma L (L = distance between clocks, with the "front" clock running behind) </li>
            </ul>
